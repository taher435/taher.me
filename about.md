I am a full stack web / mobile developer building applications for  **8+ years** now. I work with,

`NodeJS`, `ReactJS`, `AngularJS`    


`Ionic (hybrid mobile app development)`   
   
`HTML 5`, `CSS3`, `JavaScript / jQuery`   
      
`MongoDB`, `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `MS SQL Server`   
   
`Wordpress`, `LocomotiveCMS`   
   
`AWS`, `SoftLayer`, `Azure`, `Google Compute Engine`

I am a start up enthusiast and love helping different technology start ups with,

* Quick Prototyping
* Getting to product-market fit (p/m fit)
* Scale up from p/m fit
* Building and maintaining the infrastructure

I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://honestbee.sg" target="_blank">honestbee</a>. We are building a on demand platform for groceries, laundry and food.
