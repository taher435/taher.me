<p>Itâ€™s been a long time now since Windows 7 is out. Many of us must have already installed Windows 7 and must have started using. This post is for those who are planning to install Windows 7 in near future. When you install any version of Windows 7 (Home Basic/Premium, Professional or Ultimate) you get an option to choose between 32-bit or 64-bit. Before making a choice you need to know what exactly 32-bit and 64-bit OS means.</p>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">X-bit OS refers to the maximum memory your operating system can allocate to any application. The maximum memory address your operating system can assign is always 2^X. So if you have a 32 bit operating system your OS can assign maximum of 4GB (<em>2^32 = 4294967296 Bytes / 1024 = 4194304 KB / 1024 = 4096 MB /1024 = 4 GB</em>). So if you have a 32 bit OS it means that your OS cannot allocate memory to any application more than 4 GB. So if you have a RAM of 8 GB and you have a 32 bit OS then your OS never allocates memory beyond 4 GB. In that case your remaining 4 GB memory is never used. As long as you have &lt; 4GB memory I would suggest you to install 32 bit OS. 64 bit OS is only for those who has more than 4 GB of memory, then only you can have the advantage of a 64 bit OS.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>My personal experience:</strong> There are many softwares which still supports only 32 bit OS. It will take some amount of time for all software in market to support 64 bit OS. So I suggest going with only 32 bit OS.</div>
